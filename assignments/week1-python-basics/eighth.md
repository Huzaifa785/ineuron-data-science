# Assignment 8 - June 10th, 2023

1. In Python, what is the difference between a built-in function and a user-defined function? Provide an example of each.

Answer: Built-in functions are the functions that are already defined in Python. Whereas user-defined functions are the functions that are defined by the user.

Example of built-in function: `print()`

Example of user-defined function:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

2. How can you pass arguments to a function in Python? Explain the difference between positional arguments and keyword arguments.

Answer: Arguments can be passed to a function in Python by using the function name followed by the arguments enclosed in parentheses. The arguments can be passed to a function in two ways: positional arguments and keyword arguments.

Example of positional arguments:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(1, 2)

```

Example of keyword arguments:

````python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(a=1, b=2)

````

3. What is the purpose of the return statement in a function? Can a function have multiple return statements? Explain with an example.

Answer: The purpose of the return statement in a function is to return a value from the function. A function can have multiple return statements. The return statement can be used to return a value from the function and terminate the function execution. The return statement can also be used to return a value from the function and continue the function execution.

Example of a function with multiple return statements:

```python
def add(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return b
    elif b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return a + b

add(1, 2)
add(0, 2)
add(1, 0)
```

4. What are lambda functions in Python? How are they different from regular functions? Provide an example where a lambda function can be useful.

Answer: Lambda functions are anonymous functions that are defined without a name. Lambda functions are different from regular functions in the following ways:

- Lambda functions are defined without a name whereas regular functions are defined with a name.
- Lambda functions can have only one expression whereas regular functions can have multiple expressions.
- Lambda functions can have only one line of code whereas regular functions can have multiple lines of code.

Example of a lambda function:

```python
add = lambda a, b: a + b
add(1, 2)
```

5. How does the concept of "scope" apply to functions in Python? Explain the difference between local scope and global scope.

Answer: The concept of "scope" applies to functions in Python in the following ways:

- Variables defined inside a function have local scope. These variables can be accessed only inside the function.
- Variables defined outside a function have global scope. These variables can be accessed inside the function.

Example of local scope:

```python
def add(a, b):
    c = a + b
    return c

add(1, 2)
print(c) # NameError: name 'c' is not defined
```

Example of global scope:

```python
c = 0

def add(a, b):
    global c
    c = a + b
    return c

add(1, 2)
print(c) # 3
```

6. How can you use the "return" statement in a Python function to return multiple values?

Answer: The "return" statement in a Python function can be used to return multiple values by using the "return" statement multiple times.

Example of a function that returns multiple values:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

add(1, 2)
subtract(1, 2)
multiply(1, 2)
divide(1, 2)
```

7. What is the difference between the "pass by value" and "pass by reference" concepts when it
comes to function arguments in Python?

Answer: The "pass by value" concept means that the value of the argument is passed to the function. The "pass by reference" concept means that the reference of the argument is passed to the function.

Example of "pass by value":

```python

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(1, 2)

```

Example of "pass by reference":

```python

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(1, 2)

```

8. Create a function that can intake integer or decimal value and do following operations:
    a. Logarithmic function (log x)
    b. Exponential function (exp(x))
    c. Power function with base 2 (2^x)
    d. Square root

Answer:

```python
import math

def log(x):
    return math.log(x)

def exp(x):
    return math.exp(x)

def power(x):
    return math.pow(2, x)

def sqrt(x):
    return math.sqrt(x)

log(10)
exp(10)
power(10)
sqrt(10)
```

9. Create a function that takes a full name as an argument and returns first name and last name.

Answer:

```python
def get_first_and_last_name(full_name):
    first_name = full_name.split(' ')[0]
    last_name = full_name.split(' ')[1]
    return first_name, last_name

get_first_and_last_name('John Doe')
```
